# Examples using the *n*AG Library for Java

This repository contains examples and demonstrations using the [*n*AG Library for Java](https://www.nag.com/content/nag-library-for-java).  The *n*AG Library for Java contains 1900+ functions spanning many areas of numerical computing and data science.

## Directory of GitHub examples

* [Nearest Correlation Matrices](./nearest_correlation_matrices)
* [Quadratically constrained quadratic programming and its applications in portfolio optimization](./QCQP)
* [Fast Implied Volatilities](./opt_imp_vol)
* [Nonlinear Least-Squares Trust-Region Method (BXNL)](./BXNL)
* [First-order active-set method (FOAS)](./FOAS)
* [Generalized Nonlinear Data Fitting](./NLDF)

## Examples that ship with the product

The *n*AG Library for Java ships with a set of usage [examples](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/NAGJavaExamples/tree/main/simple_examples).

## Prerequisites

The *n*AG Library for Java is NOT compatible with all implementations of the *n*AG Library. It is therefore important that you ensure that the correct implementation of the *n*AG Library is installed in order to use these wrappers.

The *n*AG Library for Java Mark 27.1 is available for the following platforms:

| Platform | *n*AG Library |
| --- | --- |
| Linux 64-bit | NLL6I271BL |
| Windows 64-bit | NLW6I271EL |

You can get the *n*AG Library from [here](https://www.nag.com/content/nag-library).

## Obtaining a license

Before you can use the *n*AG Library for Java, you'll need a license. Free trial licenses are available!

To request a licence key, you first need to know your Kusari *hostid* and email that along with the *Product Code* to [support@nag.com](mailto:support@nag.com).

To get your *khostid*:

### Linux

* Run the program *khostid* located in the *license/bin/linux_x64* subdirectory of the software distribution.

* Once you have obtained one of the above licence keys, the easiest way to install it is to store the text in a file,
```
$HOME/nag.key
```
or
```
/opt/NAG/nag.key
```
or
```
/usr/local/NAG/nag.key
```

### Windows

* Use the Kusari Installer GUI. Once you have a key, the same GUI can be used to install it.

More detailed installation instructions are availavle in the [Installer's Note](https://www.nag.com/content/nag-library-mark-27).

## *n*AG Library for Java installation

You can get the *n*AG Library for Java from [here](https://www.nag.com/content/nag-library-java-download).

### Linux

To install the *n*AG Library for Java, you simply have to unzip the distribution file and copy two files to convenient locations on your system:

* NAGJava.jar
* libnag_jni271.so

The following **must** be in your *LD_LIBRARY_PATH* environment variable to use the *n*AG Library for Java:

* The directory containing *libnag_jni271.so*
* The directories *lp64/lib* and *rtl/lib/intel64* of the underlying library NLL6I271BL

It is also recommended that the path to NAGJava.jar is added to your CLASSPATH.

So your *LD_LIBRARY_PATH* should contain something like:

```
[nagjava_install_dir]/linux_x64:[nll6i271bl_install_dir]/lp64/lib:[nll6i271bl_install_dir]/rtl/lib/intel64
```

and your *CLASSPATH*:

```
.:[nagjava_install_dir]/jar/NAGJava.jar
```

If you are using an IDE such as Eclipse, you may need to configure your project to enable the IDE to pick up any required dependency.

### Windows

To install the *n*AG Library for Java, you simply have to unzip the distribution file and copy two files to convenient locations on your system:

* NAGJava.jar
* nag_jni271.dll

The following **must** be in your *PATH* environment variable to use the *n*AG Library for Java:

* The directory containing *nag_jni271.dll*
* The directories *bin* and *rtl\bin* of the underlying library NLW6I271EL

It is also recommended that the path to NAGJava.jar is added to your CLASSPATH.

So your *PATH* should contain something like:

```
[nagjava_install_dir]\win64;[nlw6i271el_install_dir]\bin;[nlw6i271el_install_dir]\rtl\bin
```

and your *CLASSPATH*:

```
.;[nagjava_install_dir]\jar\NAGJava.jar
```

If you are using an IDE such as Eclipse, you may need to configure your project to enable the IDE to pick up any required dependency.
